Since I am currently working with generalized linear models and I stumbled
upon the need of implementing one of then for a project, I decided to publish
here a small cheatsheet with the necessary equation which are needed in order
to train a statistical model.

The equations here refer to a Negative Binomial Regression with Elastic-Net
regularization.
